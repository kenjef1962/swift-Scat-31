# swift-Scat-31

An iOS application written in Swift to play the card game 31 or Scat. The game is designed in a single player vs. computer format with the computer game play dictated by a set of rules defined in the game engine.  The computer's rules have a random factor which makes the game play of the computer less predictable.

The source code has been structured to separate views, view support, and game logic.  Basic unit testing for the game engine and supporting data models is also included.
